what_is_exception_handling =

"Exception handling is a specific process that deals with errors in a manageable and predictable way.
A given program can encounter unexpected inputs or some other exceptional conditions.
Ruby's Exception class makes handling such errors easier using reserved words begin, rescue, and end.
It's essentially what my high school programming teacher, Mr. Benkendorf, called 'Stupid-User tricks.'"
